# Iris-Data-Set-Analysis

The analysis is done by first cleaning the data, then applying machine learning methods to the data and then comparing their accuracies.

Later for a better analysis, LDA feature reduction algo. is applied to the dataset to reduce the dataset to 2 variables and 1 predicted
variable. These extracted features are then applied to same machine learning algos used earlier and again their accuracies are compared.

Logistic regression and SVM classification prove to be the suitable models for the analysis.

Later, the original data set in drawn in 3D to visualize if there is anything in common that they share. 

Iris-virginica and Iris-versicolor share some properties while Iris-setosa is an isolated class.
